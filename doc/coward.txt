This plugin is only available if 'compatible' is not set.

INTRODUCTION                                    *coward*

Simple stuff; this is a plugin that automatically sets current working
directory for files. The plugin scans directories upwards and tries to find
something that looks like a VCS directory or file. If one is found, that
directory is set. If not, the file's parent directory is used.

The current default of tokens to look for is
['.git/', '.hg/', '.svn/', '.bzr/', '_darcs/']

INSTALLATION                                    *coward-installation*

The autocommand that |coward| provides is enabled by default.

CONFIGURATION                                   *coward-configuration*

                                                *g:coward_extra_tokens*
g:coward_extra_tokens~
Default: empty list

Use this option to set a list of other tokens you want to look for. |coward|
will look for these before it searches for the default ones. Both files and
directories are valid. If you add directories, make sure to add them with
a trailing slash.

Example:
>
  g:coward_extra_tokens = ['.cvs/']
<
                                                *g:coward_disable*
                                                *b:coward_disable*
g:coward_disable~
b:coward_disable~
Default: Not set

Use these options to disable the plugin, either completely or just local to
a buffer.

Example:
>
  g:coward_disable = 1
<
